## Quick Start (AIAI Execution)

### Step 1: Prepare the AI Agent

Provide this prompt to your AI Agent:

```
Assume the role of the AI Agent and execute the installation package located at [PACKAGE_PATH]. Load the package, validate its structure, and execute the installation following the AIAI Specification. Execute shell commands directly with my permission and capture all console output (stdout and stderr) to [PACKAGE_NAME]_installation.txt in the current directory.
```

**Replace:**
- `[PACKAGE_PATH]` with the path to this package directory
- `[PACKAGE_NAME]` with the package name for output file naming

### Step 2: Monitor Execution

The AI Agent will:
- Validate the package structure
- Guide you through each installation step
- Execute commands with your permission
- Capture all output to `[PACKAGE_NAME]_installation.txt`
- Adapt explanations to your technical level

### Step 3: Follow Guidance

- **Read each explanation** before executing commands
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear
- **Stop immediately** if something seems wrong
- **Trust your judgment** - you can override AI suggestions

## Understanding AI Agent Output

### Validation Messages

**Package Validation:**
- `Package structure valid` → Proceed with installation
- `Missing required file` → Check package completeness
- `Schema validation failed` → Package may be corrupted

**System Validation:**
- `[REQUIREMENT] satisfied` → System meets requirement
- `[REQUIREMENT] missing` → Resolve before proceeding
- `[REQUIREMENT] insufficient` → Consider upgrade or alternative

### Progress Indicators

**Successful Steps:**
- `Command completed successfully` → Step completed as expected
- `Validation passed` → System state confirmed
- `Moving to next step` → Proceeding to next phase

**Warning Signs:**
- `Command completed with warnings` → Check output for issues
- `Unexpected output` → Review what happened
- `Taking longer than expected` → May indicate problem

**Error Conditions:**
- `Command failed` → Stop and assess the situation
- `Validation failed` → System doesn't meet requirements
- `Rollback initiated` → Previous changes being reversed

## Manual Installation (Alternative)

If AIAI execution fails or isn't possible, you can generate manual installation instructions from the aiaiScript files:

### Generate Manual Instructions

```bash
# Generate manual installation guide
python3 tools/script2manual.py --input src/aiaiScript/ --output docs/MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md

# Or generate for specific phases
python3 tools/script2manual.py --input src/aiaiScript/ --output docs/MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md --phases "system-validation,storage-setup"
```

### Follow Generated Instructions

1. **Review the generated manual**: Check `docs/MANUAL_INSTALLATION.md`
2. **Follow step-by-step**: Execute commands in the order shown
3. **Verify each step**: Check expected outputs before proceeding
4. **Handle errors**: Use the troubleshooting guidance in the manual

### Manual Installation Features

The generated manual includes:
- **Step-by-step commands** with explanations
- **Expected outputs** and verification steps
- **Warnings** for destructive operations
- **Error handling** guidance
- **Phase organization** matching the AIAI structure

**Important:** The manual instructions are automatically generated from the aiaiScript files, ensuring consistency between AIAI and manual approaches.
