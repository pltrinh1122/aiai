# Common Directory

This directory contains shared components that are included in all AIAI Packages for distribution.

## Structure

- `tools/` - Shared tools and utilities
- `specs/` - Shared specifications and schemas

## Purpose

The common/ directory serves as a mirror copy of shared AIAI Package components that are included in all final AIAI Packages for distribution. This ensures consistency and reduces duplication across packages.
