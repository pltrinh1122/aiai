## Document Overview

This section provides a **pre-installation readiness checklist** that must be completed before proceeding to Section S3 (Ubuntu Installation). The VI framework automatically assesses your system against AI/ML development requirements and provides specific guidance for systems that don't fully meet the recommended specifications.

**Process Context**: Section S2 serves as a critical checkpoint to validate hardware specifications and provide configuration adjustments based on your actual hardware capabilities.

## Hardware Prerequisites Reference

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Impact if Below Minimum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Boot Mode** | UEFI | UEFI with Secure Boot | Installation will fail |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti | NVIDIA RTX 3080+ | Reduced training speed |
| **RAM** | 32GB (30GB+ usable) | 64GB+ (60GB+ usable) | Smaller models, reduced batch sizes |
| **Storage** | 1.5TB (1400GB+ usable) | 2TB+ (1800GB+ usable) | Reduced dataset capacity |
| **Network** | 100Mbps | 1Gbps | Slower downloads |

## PT's Hardware Specifications

- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti (24GB VRAM)
- **RAM**: 64GB DDR4
- **Storage**: 2TB NVMe SSD
- **Displays**: Dual monitor setup (DELL P2419H + Asustek VP327Q)
- **System**: Dell workstation with UEFI firmware

## S2.1 Execute System Validation

**Boot Environment**: Execute from Ubuntu 24.04 LTS USB installation environment.

### Execute Pre-Installation Validation

**MANDATORY**: Run the comprehensive pre-installation validation before proceeding.

**Framework Reference**: See **[VERIFIED_INSTALLER.md](VERIFIED_INSTALLER.md)** for complete documentation.

**Execution Command**:

```bash
sudo ./verified_installer.sh ../src/btrfs_system_validation_viScript.json --verbose | tee S2.1_validation.txt
```

**Note**: The viScript file (`../src/btrfs_system_validation_viScript.json`) is a mandatory positional argument, not an option. The `--verbose` flag enables detailed output. Only text format output is supported in the current version. The validation output is saved to `S2.1_validation.txt` for reference.



## S2.2 Validation Results and Pre-Installation Checklist

**Validation Process**: The system validation viScript performs comprehensive hardware and environment checks.

**If Validation Fails**:
- Review the validation output for specific error patterns
- Refer to **[UBUNTU-BTRFS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](UBUNTU-BTRFS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** for detailed error resolution
- Resolve all critical failures before proceeding to Section S3

**If Validation Succeeds**:
- Proceed to Section S3 with confidence
- Consider addressing any warnings for optimal performance

**Pre-Installation Checklist**:
Before proceeding to Section S3, confirm:

- [ ]  System validation completed successfully
- [ ]  All critical validation failures resolved
- [ ]  Hardware specifications meet minimum requirements
- [ ]  Configuration adjustments documented (if needed)
- [ ]  Backup of existing data completed (if applicable)
- [ ]  Installation media verified and ready
- [ ]  Power supply stable and uninterruptible

**Save for Section S3**:
- System validation report
- Hardware specification summary
- Required configuration adjustments

**For detailed validation pattern interpretation and troubleshooting guidance, see [UBUNTU-BTRFS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](UBUNTU-BTRFS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**

## S2.3 Next Steps

### If System is Ready
**Proceed to Section S3: Ubuntu Installation**
- Use standard configuration (optimal systems)
- Apply documented adjustments (adequate systems)

### If System Needs Work
**Before proceeding**:
1. Resolve critical errors identified in validation
2. Consider hardware upgrades based on recommendations
3. Re-run validation after changes
